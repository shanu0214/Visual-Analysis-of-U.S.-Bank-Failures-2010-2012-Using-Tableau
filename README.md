U.S. Bank Failures (2010–2012) – Interactive Tableau Dashboard
Tools Used: Tableau, Excel | Skills: Data Visualization, Financial Analysis, Dashboard Design

In this project, I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze U.S. bank failures between 2010 and 2012 using FDIC-reported data. The visualization focuses on trends during the post-financial crisis period, highlighting the tail end of the most turbulent years in U.S. banking history.

🔍 Key Features:
Yearly Breakdown: Explored failure counts across 2010–2012, revealing how the aftermath of the 2008 crisis impacted different states and regions.

Geographic Visualization: Mapped failures by state and region, enabling viewers to assess which areas were most affected.

Loss Estimation Insight: Analyzed the estimated financial losses tied to each bank's failure, uncovering which closures had the highest economic impact.

Interactive Filtering: Users can filter data by year, region, and state, making it easy to isolate trends and patterns.

✅ Outcomes:
This project sharpened my Tableau skills in interactive design, storytelling with data, and financial risk visualization. It highlights my ability to narrow large datasets into focused, insightful dashboards that communicate the core message effectively.
